				As an MSP it is important to know what your team is working on and a timesheet is not one of them. As an MSP you expect that as your technicians work issues, they are entering time on the tickets they are working on. So why is that when it comes time to submit timesheets, they do not always add up? </p>

				<p class="body1">All too often when someone puts in a full day of work their timesheet will have gaps. These gaps could be bathroom breaks, switching between tickets, having lunch or any number of minor interruptions. These gaps are not entirely bad, and it does not mean that your team is not working. The issue comes from trying to process timesheets at the end of the week and suddenly no one has 40 hours. </p>

				<p class="body1">TimeFix is a tool that ensures your team always has 40 hours at the end of the week. Instead of having to go into each day, create a time entry, select a charge code, fill out the details and forget how much time they need to deduct, TimeFix has a simple UI that does it for you.  </p>

				<p class="body1">Imagine if it took your team less than 5 minutes to reconcile an entire week or even an entire month! TimeFix takes the painstaking task of multiple steps that usually requires either an excellent memory or a monitor big enough for two timesheet screens and adds a new UI directly to the left-hand menu that your team can quickly access.

			<p class="body1">Have you ever opened a service ticket and emailed a client, just to realize Tom already did that 1 minute before you? Not only have you wasted your time, but you potentially just sent your client duplicate or even worse, conflicting bits of information. Instead of wasting time or accidentally impacting your client, ActiveNow shows everyone currently looking at a record as well as a brief history of who has recently accessed it. ActiveNow works on many of the screens that you and your team rely on. Instead of wondering if someone else might be looking at a Company, Contact or Ticket, you now have the full picture.</p>

	<div class="learn-more-box learn-more-thumbsup  lity-hide" id="thumbs">
		<div class="learn-more-content">
			<p class="body1">When you are looking at your service boards, it can be quite difficult to know if someone is frustrated. Their ticket often is just another line item in a queue of requests. Sentimental aims to fix that by adding a personal touch without having to review every ticket. When a ticket comes in that has a negative or unhappy score, Sentimental alerts you right away. You do not always have to grease the squeaky wheel, but if you do not even know it is squeaking, you may have it fall off. Sentimental saves you and your team time and grief by making sure they know of frustrations before the client escalates further.</p>
